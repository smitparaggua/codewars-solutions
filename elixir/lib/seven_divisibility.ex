  A number m of the form 10x + y is divisible by 7 if and only if x âˆ’ 2y is
  divisible by 7. In other words, subtract twice the last digit from the number
  formed by the remaining digits. Continue to do this until a number known to be
  divisible or not by 7 is obtained; you can stop when this number has at most 2
  digits because you are supposed to know if a number of at most 2 digits is
  divisible by 7 or not.

  The original number is divisible by 7 if and only if the last number obtained using this procedure is divisible by 7.
